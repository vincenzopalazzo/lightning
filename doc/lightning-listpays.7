.SH NAME
lightning-listpays - Command for querying payment status
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBlistpays\fR [bolt11] [payment_hash]

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fBlistpay\fR RPC command gets the status of all \fIpay\fR commands, or a
single one if \fIbolt11\fR or \fIpayment_hash\fR are specified (no both)\.

.SH RETURN VALUE

On success, an array of objects is returned\. Each object contains:

.RS
.IP \[bu]

\fIbolt11\fR: (if the payment was did with pay command)
the \fIbolt11\fR argument given to \fIpay\fR (see below for exceptions)\.


.IP \[bu]

\fIpayment_hash\fR:
the \fIpayment_hash\fR argument givent to \fIkeysend\fR


.IP \[bu]

\fIstatus\fR:
one of \fIcomplete\fR, \fIfailed\fR or \fIpending\fR\.


.IP \[bu]

\fIpayment_preimage\fR:
(if \fIstatus\fR is \fIcomplete\fR) proves payment was received\.


.IP \[bu]

\fIlabel\fR:
optional \fIlabel\fR, if provided to \fIpay\fR\.


.IP \[bu]

\fIamount_sent_msat\fR:
total amount sent, in "NNNmsat" format\.



.RE

For old payments (pre-0\.7) we didnâ€™t save the \fIbolt11\fR string, so in its
place are three other fields:


\fIpayment_hash\fR
the hash of the \fIpayment_preimage\fR which will prove payment\.


\fIdestination\fR
the final destination of the payment\.


\fIamount_msat\fR
the amount the destination received, in "NNNmsat" format\.


These three can all be extracted from \fIbolt11\fR, hence are obsolete\.
